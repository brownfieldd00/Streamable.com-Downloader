# Streamable.com Downloader
 
I was tired of manually opening DevTools and selecting the video, getting the URL so I decided to create an extension that would do the job for me.

# How to install?
1. Download this repository as a zip file. (Code tab > Download ZIP)
2. Unpack the zip file to any location (outside Download folder to avoid deleting it by accident)
3. Head to __chrome://extensions__
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click __Load unpacked__
6. Select the folder you extracted the zip to.
7. It should be installed.

# How to use?
The extension will add a __Download__ anchor at the bottom of the screen when you go to a video on  __www.streamable.com__

If you are having any problem with the extension. Make sure to let me know.
